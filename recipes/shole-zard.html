    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Sholezard is a traditional Iranian dessert that is yellow due to the presence of saffron and is topped with cinnamon, almond slices, and pistachio slices. Sholezard is generally cooked in one way, and it is especially used for breaking the fast during the month of Ramadan. Generally, people liken this dessert to jelly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jasmine rice <em>1 cup</em></li>
        <li><em>6 cups</em> boiling water</li>
        <li><em>2 cups</em> granulated sugar</li>
        <li><em>2⅓ cups</em> extra boiling water (to be added later)</li>
        <li><em>¼ cup</em> rosewater</li>
        <li><em>¼ tsp</em> ground saffron</li>
        <li><strong>GARNISH:</strong></li>
        <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>Slivered or chopped unsalted pistachio nuts</li>
        <li>Dried rose petals</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick</strong> through the rice, add it to a bowl and wash in cold water. Drain and wash couple of more times each time with fresh cold water. Drain all the water.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> rice and boiling water to a deep nonstick 3-Qt saucepan. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to just above the low marking. Simmer with a low boil without covering the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Do</strong> Not Stir for 1 hour 15 minutes. Most of the water will be cooked off and the rice should be completely tender. To test the rice, very gently squeeze one grain between thumb and index finger; it should fall apart with a sticky texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Add</strong> 2⅓ cups boiling water, 2 cups sugar, ¼ cup rosewater, and ¼ tsp saffron. Increase the heat to med low and bring it to a boil. Continue cooking on medium low for 5 more minutes, or until Sholeh Zard thickens. Use a wooden spoon to stir several times so the Sholeh Zard does not stick to the bottom or sides of the pan. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Pour</strong> into 6-ounce cups and cool in room temperature. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours until completely chilled. At this point the dishes may be stored, covered tightly with a plastic wrap, for several hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish</strong> with ground cinnamon, slivered pistachios or almonds, and a few dried rose petals before serving and Enjoy!!</li>
